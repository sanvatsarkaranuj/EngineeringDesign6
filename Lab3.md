## Installing Necessary Python Packages
Before executing the python code I installed jdcal, astral and geopy. I did this by executing the following commands: `pip3 install jdcal`, 
`pip3 install astral`,
`pip3 install geopy`.

## Executing Python Code: 

## cd ~/iot
This command changes directories to iot. Note that in a previous lab the iot GitHub repository was copied. The directory "iot" has access to all files/folders from this repository.
